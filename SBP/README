The contents of this directory are compiled with with CPSA Version 4.4.2 using
the provided Makefile. Compiling the contents requires at least 2 GB of free RAM.

To facilitate termination, we divide the mTLS 1.3 model into two files, one
corresponding to each perspective (client or server/proxy).

Brief descriptions of each model in this directory are below.

tls12_ca.scm: baseline "pre-SBP" model using TLS 1.2.
tls13_ca.scm: pre-SBP model using TLS 1.3.
tls12_sbp.scm: model of the original SBP using TLS 1.2.
tls13_sbp.scm: model of a custom SBP using TLS 1.3.
mtls12_sbp.scm: model of a custom SBP using mTLS 1.2.
mtls13_sbp_client.scm: client perspective of custom SBP using mTLS 1.3.
mtls13_sbp_server.scm: server perspective of custom SBP using mTLS 1.3.

For convenience, the contents of this directory are precompiled. For each
model, there are four files:

*.scm: the CPSA specification of the model.
*.txt: the raw output resulting from executing CPSA against the model.
*_shapes.txt: pruned output for the model that only includes shapes.
*.xhtml: visualizations of all skeletons for a model.
*_shapes.xhtml: visualizations of realized skeletons (shapes) for the model.

We recommend inspecting the graphical shapes for any models of interest.
